# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The project requires the analysis of all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 in order to create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. The purpose of the project is to understand how the ride-sharing information by city differs, and how that information can be used by V. Isualize and the rest of the Pyber team to make analysis based decisions by looking at city type to compete effectively in the ride sharing market. The analysis will be used to supply three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
